 All the code you see is made or modified by Sutej Singh.

Contact Sutej Singh at sutejsingh1901@gmail.com to ask if you can copy the code and claim it to be yours.

Remember that Sutej Singh is a busy man. He is usually roaming the city wearing a bat mask and shouting "I am Batman" at people. Or he is usually practicing to run fast enough to be able to walk on water. Or he is usually working with doctors to find ways to cure cancer. He is also found advising Supreme Court judges on extremely difficult cases. He once almost colonised Mars. He once speed-walked near the speed of light but Nature told him to back-off. He uses wormholes as a frequent mode of transportation and still arrives late at appointments.  

So as you can see, Sutej Singh is a very busy man, so he may not be able to reply to your email fast enough.
